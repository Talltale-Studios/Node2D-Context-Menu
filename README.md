# Node2D-Context-Menu
Adds a Context Menu for Node2D nodes (and node types that extend Node2D) in the 2D editor.

To open the Context Menu, select a Node2D node and then right click anywhere in the 2D editor's viewport.

*Note: The root node of the scene must be of the "CanvasItem" base class (meaning Node2D and Control nodes, and any nodes that extend them) for the Context Menu to work.*

## Context Menu Features:
- Move selected node to mouse position
- Move selected node to mouse position with grid snapping
- Invert selected node's scale hosizontally
- Invert selected node's scale vertically
- Reset selected node's scale
